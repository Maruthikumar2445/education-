*   **Hands-On Practice:** FreeCodeCamp and Google's Python Class encourage active learning through coding exercises, a crucial element for retaining information.

**3. Suggested Schedule (10 hours per week):**

This schedule is a suggestion and you should adjust it based on your personal pace and preferences.

*   **Week 1-3: Python Fundamentals (5 hours/week)**
    *   **Option 1:**
        *   Python for Everybody (Coursera - Audit): 3 hours (watch lectures, read materials)
        *   FreeCodeCamp: Scientific Computing with Python (2 hours)
    *   **Option 2:**
        *   Google's Python Class: 2 hours
        *   FreeCodeCamp: Scientific Computing with Python (3 hours)
*   **Week 1-3: Supplemental Videos and Community (5 hours/week)**
    *   Sentdex or Corey Schafer videos (2 hours - focus on topics covered in the course you are taking.)
    *   Practice Problems from course (2 hours)
    *   Join a community (see below) and engage (1 hour).  Ask questions, help others.
*   **Week 4-6: More Advanced Topics (5 hours/week)**
    *   Continue on Python for Everybody (Coursera) or Google's Python Class. 3 Hours.

**Important Notes on Schedule:**

*   **Be Consistent:**  The key to success is consistency. Try to stick to your schedule as much as possible. Even if you can only dedicate 30 minutes on a particular day, it's better than nothing.
*   **Take Breaks:**  Avoid burnout by taking regular breaks. Step away from the computer, go for a walk, or do something completely different.
*   **Don't Be Afraid to Revisit:** If you're struggling with a concept, don't hesitate to go back and review previous material.
*   **Adjust As Needed:** This is just a starting point. Feel free to adjust the schedule and resources based on your progress and preferences.

**Key Takeaways for Visual Learners:**

*   **Actively Visualize:** When reading or watching tutorials, try to visualize the code in your mind.  Draw diagrams, create mental models, or use online visualization tools to help you understand the flow of data and execution.
*   **Experiment:** Don't be afraid to experiment with the code.  Change variables, add new lines, and see what happens.  This is a great way to learn by doing and to solidify your understanding of the concepts.
*   **Focus on Projects:** Work on small, achievable projects that are visually interesting to you. This will keep you motivated and help you see the practical applications of what you're learning.

Remember that this is just a starting point. Be flexible, adapt the plan to your own needs, and most importantly, have fun learning!  Good luck!
