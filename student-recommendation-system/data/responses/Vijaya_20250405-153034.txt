    *   **Good old-fashioned paper and pen/pencil:**  Sometimes the best way to really absorb something is to write it out.
*   **Diagramming Tools:**
    *   **draw.io (diagrams.net):**  Create diagrams, flowcharts, and mind maps to visualize concepts.
    *   **Lucidchart:** Another popular diagramming tool.

**Key Considerations:**

*   **Consistency is key:** Stick to your schedule as much as possible, even if it's just for a short amount of time each day.
*   **Don't be afraid to ask for help:**  Use the online communities to ask questions when you're stuck.
*   **Focus on understanding, not just memorization:**  Make sure you understand the "why" behind the concepts, not just the "how."
*   **Build projects:**  Apply what you learn by building small projects. This will help you solidify your knowledge and build your portfolio.
*   **Adjust as needed:** This is just a starting point.  Adjust the schedule, resources, and difficulty level as you progress and discover what works best for you. If you find you are making progress, feel free to increase the time commitment or number of resources.
*   **Be patient:** Learning takes time. Don't get discouraged if you don't understand something right away. Keep practicing and you will eventually get there.

Good luck with your learning journey! Remember to have fun and explore your interests.
