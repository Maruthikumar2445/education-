**II. Computer Science: Intermediate Level**

**Learning Goal:** Improve understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms, focusing on visual representations and implementation.

**Recommended Resources:**

1.  **Resource Name:**  VisuAlgo
    *   **Provider:** Steven Halim and Felix Halim (National University of Singapore)
    *   **Description:** VisuAlgo provides interactive visualizations of various data structures and algorithms.  You can step through the execution of algorithms and see how data structures change in real time.  Includes search, sorting, graph, and string algorithms.
    *   **Estimated Time Commitment:** ~2-3 hours (experimenting with visualizations and understanding how different algorithms work)
    *   **Link:** [https://visualgo.net/en](https://visualgo.net/en)
    *   **Cost:** Free
    *   **Why it matches your preferences:** Highly visual and interactive. Data structures and algorithms are intermediate difficulty.

2.  **Resource Name:** Data Structures Easy to Advanced Course - Full Tutorial from a Google Engineer
    *   **Provider:** freeCodeCamp.org (YouTube)
    *   **Description:** This video course provides a good overview of common data structures (arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, etc.) and algorithms. The instructor is a Google Engineer so the explanations are grounded in real-world application.
    *   **Estimated Time Commitment:** ~ 3-4 hours (watch a section of the videos and work through the exercises)
    *   **Link:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBSGKlAvoiM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBSGKlAvoiM)
    *   **Cost:** Free
    *   **Why it matches your preferences:**  Addresses intermediate topics. Online video. Explanations are relatively easy to understand.

3. **Resource Name:** CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript
    * **Provider:** Harvard University (edX)
    * **Description:** This course is great for those with some programming experience and covers how to design and implement databases, APIs, web applications, and more, using Python and JavaScript.
    * **Estimated Time Commitment:** Varies depending on background.  Start with 1-2 hours/week.
    * **Link:** [https://www.edx.org/course/web-programming-with-python-and-javascript](https://www.edx.org/course/web-programming-with-python-and-javascript)
    * **Cost:** Free to audit. (Certificate is paid)
    * **Why it matches your preferences:** Introduces web programming concepts using Python and JavaScript, both industry-standard languages. While there's coding involved (hands-on), there are visual elements of seeing your code come to life in a website, giving it the visual appeal you're looking for.

**III. Suggested Schedule (8 hours per week)**

*   **Monday:**
    *   Mathematics: 1.5 hours - 3Blue1Brown - Watch a video and take notes.
    *   Computer Science: 1.5 hours - VisuAlgo - Experiment with visualizing a specific algorithm.
*   **Wednesday:**
    *   Mathematics: 1.5 hours - Khan Academy Multivariable Calculus - Watch a video lesson and complete a practice problem.
    *   Computer Science: 1.5 hours - freeCodeCamp.org DS & Algorithms - Watch a video section and work through examples.
*   **Friday:**
    *   Mathematics: 1 hour - Visual Calculus - Review a concept you are struggling with.
    *   Computer Science: 1 hour - Harvard's CS50 Web Programming - Watch a video and work on exercises.

**IV. Additional Tools and Communities**

*   **Desmos:** (desmos.com) - Excellent online graphing calculator for visualizing mathematical functions and concepts.
*   **GeoGebra:** (geogebra.org) - Dynamic mathematics software for geometry, algebra, calculus, and more, with interactive applets.
*   **Stack Overflow:** (stackoverflow.com) - A Q&A site for programmers; a great resource for getting help with coding problems.
*   **Reddit:** (reddit.com/r/learnmath, reddit.com/r/learnprogramming) - Online communities for learning math and programming, respectively.
*   **Discord Servers:** Many online communities exist for specific programming languages, technologies, and mathematical topics. Search for relevant Discord servers on Discord's discovery page.

**Important Notes:**

*   **Adapt and Adjust:** This is just a starting point. Regularly assess your progress and adjust the schedule and resources as needed. If you find a particular resource isn't working for you, don't hesitate to try something different.
*   **Active Learning:** Don't just passively watch videos or read books. Actively engage with the material by taking notes, working through examples, and trying to apply what you're learning to solve problems.
*   **Consistency is Key:**  Even if you can't dedicate the full 8 hours some weeks, try to do at least a little bit each week to maintain momentum.
*   **Seek Help:** Don't be afraid to ask for help when you get stuck. Use the online communities and other resources to connect with other learners and experts.

Good luck with your learning journey!  Let me know if you have any other questions or would like me to refine this plan further.
