Okay, here's a personalized learning plan based on your preferences, designed to be engaging, kinesthetic-friendly, and free, while accommodating your limited time.

**OVERALL STRATEGY:**

Given your kinesthetic learning style and limited time, we'll focus on resources that offer practical activities, interactive elements, or suggestions for incorporating movement and real-world connections into your learning. We will divide your single hour into three shorter sessions per week, one for each subject, with additional "brain break" movement periods recommended within each session.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Adaptability:** This is a starting point. Adjust the schedule and resources to fit your specific needs and interests.
*   **Active Engagement:** The key to kinesthetic learning is active participation. Don't just passively consume information. Get up, move around, and engage with the material in a physical way.
*   **Experimentation:** Try different activities and see what works best for you.
*   **Don't be afraid to dive deeper:** If a particular topic sparks your interest, don't hesitate to explore it further. Use the resources listed here as a starting point for your own independent research.
* **Take breaks.** Over studying will decrease learning and retention.
* **Repetition and review.** Reviewing your work will help to cement it in your mind.

Have fun exploring these subjects! Let me know if you have any other questions.
