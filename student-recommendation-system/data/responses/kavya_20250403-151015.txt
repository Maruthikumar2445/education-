*   **Apply What You Learn:** Work on personal projects to solidify your understanding and build your portfolio.  This is especially important in computer science.
*   **Review:**  Make time to periodically review what you've learned to reinforce your knowledge.
*   **Visualisation Tools:** Use mind maps, diagrams, and whiteboards to visualize concepts, especially in mathematics.  For computer science, draw out data structures or program flowcharts.

This is a comprehensive starting point. Adjust the plan based on your progress, interests, and any changes in your schedule. Good luck with your learning journey!
