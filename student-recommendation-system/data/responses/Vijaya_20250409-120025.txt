Okay, here's a structured learning plan tailored to your preferences.  It aims to balance your diverse interests, mixed learning style, and intermediate skill level within the confines of 9 hours per week. Remember to adjust this schedule and resources based on your personal progress and enjoyment. I'll focus on free or affordable resources where possible, and explicitly state when certification is available.

**Overall Strategy:**

*   **Mix and Match:** Each subject will have a blend of resources to cater to your mixed learning style.
*   **Focused Deep Dives:** Instead of superficially touching everything, we'll focus on key concepts within each subject.
*   **Time Blocking:** We'll assign specific time slots to each subject to maintain consistency.
*   **Flexibility:**  Don't be afraid to swap resources or adjust the schedule if something isn't working for you.
*   **Active Learning:**  The plan emphasizes active learning: problem-solving, coding, analyzing, and creating, rather than just passive consumption.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Flexibility is Key:** This is just a starting point. Adjust the schedule based on your individual needs and interests. If you find yourself enjoying one subject more than another, dedicate more time to it.
*   **Active Recall:**  Don't just passively read or watch videos.  Actively try to recall information, do practice problems, and explain concepts to yourself.
*   **Spaced Repetition:**  Use a spaced repetition system (like Anki) to review material you've already learned. This will help you retain information over the long term.
*   **Burnout:** Be careful and do not burn yourself out. It's ok to take breaks and go back to the work later.

**Additional Tools and Communities:**

*   **Discord Servers:** Many online communities are dedicated to specific subjects (e.g., CS50 has a very active Discord). Search for relevant Discord servers for each of your subjects.  These are great for asking questions and getting help from other learners.
*   **Stack Exchange (Mathematics, Computer Science, Physics):** Excellent for finding answers to specific questions.
*   **Reddit:** Subreddits like r/learnprogramming, r/math, r/biology, r/physics, and r/musictheory can provide resources, discussions, and support.
*   **Anki:** A flashcard program based on spaced repetition.
*   **Wolfram Alpha:** A computational knowledge engine useful for calculations and exploring mathematical concepts.

This plan provides a solid foundation for your learning journey. Remember to adapt it to your own needs, stay curious, and enjoy the process of learning!  Good luck!
