**Important Considerations:**

*   **Consistency is Key:**  Even with only 2 hours a week, try to stick to the schedule as much as possible.  Even short, regular sessions are more effective than infrequent, longer ones.
*   **Active Learning:** Don't just passively watch videos.  Pause the videos, try the code yourself, and experiment. Work through the practice problems and try to modify the examples.
*   **Don't Be Afraid to Ask for Help:**  Use the online communities mentioned above to ask questions when you get stuck.  Explaining your problem to others is a great way to learn.
*   **Focus on Understanding, Not Memorization:** Aim to understand the underlying principles behind the concepts.  Memorization is less useful in the long run.
*   **Have Fun!** Learning should be enjoyable. If you're not enjoying a particular resource, try something else.  There are many different ways to learn, so find what works best for you.
*   **Adjust as needed:**  This is just a starting point.  As you learn more, you'll discover your own interests and learning style.  Adjust the plan as needed to fit your needs and preferences.
*   **Explore alternatives:** This learning plan provides recommendations for math and computer science resources. You could also explore alternatives for your learning plan.

This detailed plan provides a strong foundation in both Mathematics and Computer Science, tailored to your learning style and time constraints. Good luck!
