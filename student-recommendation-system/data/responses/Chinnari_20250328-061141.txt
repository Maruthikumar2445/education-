Okay, here's a personalized learning plan structured to your preferences, focusing on free resources and a kinesthetic learning style. It covers Mathematics and Computer Science at an advanced level, designed for a high school student with 10 hours per week.

**Overall Learning Goals (Assumptions):** I'm assuming you want to significantly deepen your understanding in both subjects, preparing you for advanced coursework (e.g., AP classes, college-level material, competitive programming), and that you want to develop practical, hands-on skills.  If you have *more* specific goals (e.g., "I want to learn game development" or "I want to excel in calculus"), please let me know, and I can refine the recommendations.

**Important Considerations for Kinesthetic Learning with Online Resources:**

*   **Active Participation is Key:** Because true physical kinesthetic learning is difficult with digital resources, your "kinesthetic" learning will be enhanced by *actively* engaging with the material.  This means doing problems, coding along with videos, writing down notes, and building projects.
*   **Hands-on Projects:** The most effective way to learn is to *do*. Focus on projects that allow you to apply your knowledge in tangible ways.
*   **Break Down Learning:** Split your learning into shorter, manageable chunks.
*   **Experimentation:**  Don't be afraid to try different approaches and experiment with what you're learning.
*   **Seek Feedback:** Ask questions and get feedback from others on your work.

**IV. Kinesthetic Enhancements**

*   **Use Whiteboards/Paper:** Even with digital resources, use a whiteboard or paper to sketch out ideas, diagrams, and code snippets. This helps with visualization and active recall.
*   **Take Breaks and Move:** Don't sit for hours without moving. Take regular breaks to stretch, walk around, or do some physical activity.
*   **Explain Concepts Out Loud:** Try explaining what you're learning to someone else (even a stuffed animal). This forces you to organize your thoughts and identify areas where you're struggling.
*   **Build Physical Prototypes (Where Applicable):**  If you're learning about hardware or electronics, consider building small physical prototypes to experiment with.

**Important Notes:**

*   **Adapt the Plan:** This is just a starting point. Adjust the schedule and resources based on your own progress, interests, and learning style.
*   **Prioritize Projects:** The more you focus on building projects that interest you, the more engaged you'll be and the faster you'll learn.
*   **Don't Be Afraid to Ask for Help:** Reach out to online communities, friends, or teachers when you get stuck.
*   **Consistency is Key:** Even if you only have 30 minutes on a given day, try to do something related to your learning goals.  Small, consistent effort adds up over time.

I hope this comprehensive learning plan helps you on your journey in mathematics and computer science!  Good luck!  Let me know if you have more specific goals, and I'll tailor the plan further.
