Okay, here's a personalized learning plan tailored to your preferences. I've focused on free resources that are suitable for a visual learner in high school with an intermediate skill level in mathematics and computer science.

**Overall Strategy:**

*   **Mathematics:** Reinforce foundational concepts and introduce more advanced topics in a visual manner.
*   **Computer Science:** Focus on practical coding skills and problem-solving using visual aids and demonstrations.
*   **Flexibility:** The schedule is a suggestion; adjust it based on your progress and interests.
*   **Active Learning:** Emphasize practice and problem-solving, not just passive watching.

**1. Mathematics**

*   **Goal:** Strengthen Algebra and Trigonometry skills, introduce Calculus concepts, and develop problem-solving abilities.
