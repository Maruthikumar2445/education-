**V. Important Considerations:**

*   **Active Learning:** Don't just passively watch videos.  Take notes, work through examples, and try to solve problems on your own.
*   **Consistency:**  Even short, regular study sessions are more effective than long, infrequent ones.
*   **Adaptability:**  If a resource isn't working for you, don't be afraid to switch to something else.
*   **Patience:** Learning takes time. Don't get discouraged if you don't understand something right away. Keep practicing and seeking help when needed.
*   **Track Progress:** Keep track of your progress and celebrate your accomplishments to stay motivated.
*   **Focus:** Prioritize one goal for each subject at a time. Start with the math courses, then start the computer science courses.
*   **Cost Savings:** Look for discounts on Coursera or explore options for financial aid if cost is a barrier.  Consider auditing courses for free to see if they are a good fit before paying for a certificate.

This plan should give you a solid starting point for your learning journey. Good luck! Let me know if you have any other questions.
