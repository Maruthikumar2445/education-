*   **Don't be afraid to ask for help:**  Use online forums or reach out to classmates or instructors when you're stuck.
*   **Focus on understanding, not memorization:**  Try to understand the underlying concepts rather than just memorizing formulas or code.  This will make it easier to apply what you've learned in new situations.
*   **Practice regularly:**  The best way to learn mathematics and computer science is to practice.  Work through examples, solve problems, and write code.
*   **Adapt the plan as needed:**  If you find that a particular resource isn't working for you, don't be afraid to switch to something else. The best learning plan is one that fits your individual needs and preferences.

This structured plan should give you a good starting point for your learning journey. Good luck!
