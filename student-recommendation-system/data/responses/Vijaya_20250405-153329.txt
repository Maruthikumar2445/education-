**IV. Suggested Schedule (10 hours/week Total)**

This is a sample schedule; adjust it to your preferences and priorities:

*   **Monday:**
    *   Mathematics: Khan Academy - High School Geometry (1 hour)
    *   Computer Science: CS50 Lecture (1 hour)
*   **Tuesday:**
    *   Computer Science: CS50 Lecture (1 hour)
    *   Computer Science: CodingBat (30 minutes)
*   **Wednesday:**
    *   Mathematics: 3Blue1Brown - Essence of Calculus (1.5 hours)
*   **Thursday:**
    *   Computer Science: FreeCodeCamp (1 hour)
    *   Computer Science: CodingBat (30 minutes)
*   **Friday:**
    *   Mathematics: Brilliant.org (Free Tier) (1 hour)
*   **Saturday/Sunday:**  Flexibility - Review concepts, work on projects, watch Prof.R.Raja Subramanian Video

**V. Additional Tools and Communities:**

*   **Online Forums:**
    *   **Stack Overflow:**  A Q&A website for programmers. Invaluable for debugging and finding solutions to coding problems.
    *   **Reddit:** Subreddits like r/learnprogramming, r/math, r/compsci, and r/learnmath are excellent places to ask questions and connect with other learners.
*   **Code Editors:**  Use a code editor like VS Code (Visual Studio Code) for coding projects. It's free and has many helpful extensions.
*   **Discord Servers:** Many online learning communities have Discord servers where you can chat with other students in real-time.

**VI. Important Considerations:**

*   **Prioritization:**  If 10 hours is a hard limit, you might need to focus on the core concepts in CS50 and FreeCodeCamp and/or reduce time dedicated to optional exercises.
*   **Flexibility:** Don't be afraid to adjust the schedule based on your progress and interests.
*   **Active Learning:** Don't just passively watch videos. Take notes, try the exercises, and ask questions.
*   **Consistency:**  Even small amounts of consistent effort are more effective than sporadic bursts of studying.
*   **Burnout:** If you feel overwhelmed, take a break. It's better to learn at a sustainable pace than to burn out quickly.

This plan provides a solid foundation in both mathematics and computer science, tailored to your visual learning style and time constraints. Good luck!
