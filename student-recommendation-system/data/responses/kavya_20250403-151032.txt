**V.  Personalization and Adaptation**

*   **Regularly assess your progress:**  Are you understanding the material?  Are the courses challenging enough?  If a resource isn't working for you, don't be afraid to switch to a different one.
*   **Adjust the difficulty level:** If you find the resources too easy, look for more advanced materials. If they are too difficult, review the prerequisites or find simpler explanations.
*   **Focus on your strengths:** If you are particularly strong in one area (e.g., algebra), use that to your advantage when learning more difficult concepts (e.g., calculus).

This learning plan is a starting point. Customize it to fit your individual needs, interests, and goals. Good luck with your learning journey!
