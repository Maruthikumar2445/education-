    *   **Description:** This is a text-based tutorial with videos embedded, exercises, and solutions. It covers basic Python concepts and includes topics like strings, lists, dictionaries, and regular expressions.
    *   **Estimated Time Commitment:** 3-5 hours per week
    *   **Link:** [https://developers.google.com/edu/python](https://developers.google.com/edu/python)
    *   **Cost:** Free

    *   **Why it matches your preferences:** This course utilizes video lectures, coding examples, and exercises which cater to visual learners. It's designed for beginners with simple and clear instructions, and the Google brand provides a sense of quality and reliability. It also provides plenty of free resources.

**2. Why These Resources Match Your Preferences**

*   **Visual Learning Style:** These resources utilize videos, diagrams, code examples, and practical exercises to aid visual understanding.
*   **Beginner Level:** Each resource assumes little to no prior programming experience.
*   **Online Courses & Videos:** All are delivered online through courses and supplementary videos.
*   **Free Resources:** All the resources listed are available for free.

**3. Suggested Weekly Schedule (10 Hours)**

This schedule is a suggestion; feel free to adjust it based on your preferences and how quickly you progress.

*   **Monday:**
    *   CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python:  Lecture video (1-2 hours)
    *   Work on the problem set from CS50 (1 hour)
*   **Tuesday:**
    *   FreeCodeCamp: Work through a module of Scientific Computing with Python (2 hours)
*   **Wednesday:**
    *   Google's Python Class: Work through tutorials and practice (2 hours)
*   **Thursday:** Rest or Review
*   **Friday:**
    *   CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python: Work on the problem set (2 hours)
*   **Weekend:**
    *   Review and practice topics covered during the week.  (Optional: Spend any remaining time exploring additional features or doing extra exercises.)

**Important Considerations for the Schedule:**

*   **Consistency is Key:** Try to stick to your schedule as much as possible. Even small increments of progress add up over time.
*   **Don't Be Afraid to Adjust:** If you're finding a particular resource difficult or boring, don't be afraid to switch to a different one or modify the schedule.
*   **Prioritize Understanding:** Focus on understanding the *why* behind the code, not just memorizing syntax. This will make you a much more effective programmer in the long run.
*   **Practice Regularly:** Coding is a skill that improves with practice. Write small programs, experiment with code, and try to solve problems.

**4. Additional Tools and Communities**

*   **Integrated Development Environment (IDE):**
    *   **VS Code (Free):** [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Highly popular and customizable IDE with Python support. Great for writing and running Python code.  Offers extensions for debugging, linting, and more.
    *   **Thonny (Free):** [https://thonny.org/](https://thonny.org/) - An IDE specifically designed for beginners. It's simple to use and provides helpful visualizations of program execution.
    *   **Why IDEs help:** IDEs help by formatting your code, highlighting syntax errors, and providing debugging tools. Visual feedback makes coding easier.
*   **Online Code Editors:**
    *   **Google Colaboratory (Free):** [https://colab.research.google.com/](https://colab.research.google.com/) - Allows you to write and execute Python code in your browser. Great for quick experiments and sharing code.
    *   **Repl.it (Free Tier Available):** [https://replit.com/](https://replit.com/) - Browser-based IDE that supports multiple languages, including Python. Good for collaborative coding.
*   **Online Communities:**
    *   **Stack Overflow:** [https://stackoverflow.com/](https://stackoverflow.com/) - A Q&A site for programmers. If you have a question, chances are someone has already asked and answered it here.
    *   **Reddit (r/learnpython):** [https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/) - A subreddit dedicated to learning Python. A great place to ask questions, share resources, and connect with other learners.
    *   **Discord Servers:** Search for Python learning Discord servers. Many exist and offer real-time help and support.
    *   **Why communities help:** You can get your questions answered, help others learn, and meet like-minded individuals who share your passion for programming.

**Key Takeaways**

*   Start with the foundational concepts. Don't try to rush into advanced topics before you have a solid understanding of the basics.
*   Be patient with yourself. Learning to program takes time and effort. Don't get discouraged if you struggle at first. Everyone does.
*   Practice, practice, practice! The more you code, the better you'll become.
*   Engage with the community.  Ask questions, share your code, and help others.

This structured learning plan is a starting point. Adjust it based on your individual needs and learning style. Good luck, and have fun learning Python!
