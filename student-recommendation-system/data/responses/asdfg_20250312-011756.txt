**Key Considerations and Tips:**

*   **Consistency is Key:** Stick to your schedule as much as possible. Even short, regular study sessions are more effective than long, infrequent ones.
*   **Active Learning:** Don't just passively watch videos or read. Actively take notes, solve problems, and try to explain concepts in your own words.
*   **Don't Be Afraid to Ask for Help:** If you're stuck, don't hesitate to ask for help on online forums or from friends/teachers.
*   **Take Breaks:** Avoid burnout by taking regular breaks and getting enough sleep.
*   **Practice, Practice, Practice:** The more you practice, the better you'll become.  Coding and math skills are developed through consistent effort.
*   **Personal Projects:** Work on personal projects to apply your knowledge. This will make learning more engaging and help you retain information.
*   **Review Regularly:**  Set aside time each week to review what you've learned. This will help solidify your understanding and prevent you from forgetting important concepts.

This plan provides a solid framework for your learning journey. Remember to adapt it to your specific needs and preferences. Good luck!
