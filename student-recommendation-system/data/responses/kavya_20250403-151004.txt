*   **Reddit:** Find subreddits like r/learnprogramming, r/math, or language-specific communities.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Consistency is Key:**  Even short, regular study sessions are more effective than sporadic long sessions.
*   **Active Learning:** Don't just passively watch videos or read tutorials. Actively work through examples, solve problems, and experiment.
*   **Don't Be Afraid to Ask for Help:**  Use the online communities and forums mentioned above to ask questions and get feedback.
*   **Celebrate Small Wins:** Acknowledge your progress and reward yourself for achieving milestones.
*   **Adapt and Adjust:**  This is just a suggested plan.  If a resource isn't working for you, switch to something else.  The key is to find what resonates with your learning style and keeps you motivated.
*   **Take Breaks:** Regular breaks will help you stay focused and prevent burnout.  Step away from your screen and do something you enjoy.
*   **Focus:** Work in a quiet place that you're not easily distracted.
