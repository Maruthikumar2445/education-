Okay, here's a personalized learning plan tailored to your preferences, focusing on Mathematics and Computer Science for a High School student with a visual learning style, intermediate difficulty, 10 hours/week availability, and a preference for free online resources:

**Learning Goals (You need to specify these!)**

Before we dive in, I need you to fill in your *specific* learning goals. This is crucial for tailoring the plan.  Here are a few examples, pick one or modify one, or come up with your own.  Be as specific as possible.

*   **Goal 1 (Math):** Improve my understanding of Pre-Calculus topics such as trigonometry, functions, and conic sections to prepare for AP Calculus.
*   **Goal 2 (CS):**  Learn the fundamentals of Python programming and be able to build simple console-based applications (e.g., a text-based game, a calculator, a simple data analysis script).
*   **Goal 1 (Math):** Master the skills required for succeeding in the AMC 10/12 competition.
*   **Goal 2 (CS):** Understand the basics of web development and create a simple portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

**Please tell me what your specific goals are!  I will then adjust the plan below accordingly.**

**Once you provide your learning goals, I will adjust the recommendations below.  For now, I'll assume the following:**

*   **Goal 1 (Math):** Improve my understanding of Pre-Calculus topics such as trigonometry, functions, and conic sections.
*   **Goal 2 (CS):** Learn the fundamentals of Python programming and be able to build simple console-based applications.
