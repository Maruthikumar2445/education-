    *   **Cost:** Free
    *   **Why it fits:**  FreeCodeCamp is entirely hands-on. You learn by doing, building real-world projects in Python.

*   **Resource:** CS50's Introduction to Computer Science (Harvard OpenCourseWare)
    *   **Provider:** Harvard University
    *   **Description:**  A foundational computer science course covering a wide range of topics, including algorithms, data structures, memory management, and web development. Uses C and Python.  Although lectures are included, the problem sets (PSETS) are the core and require considerable hands-on coding.
    *   **Estimated Time Commitment:**  3-4 hours per week (watching lectures, working on problem sets).
    *   **Link:** [https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/)
    *   **Cost:** Free
    *   **Why it fits:** CS50 emphasizes problem-solving and practical application of concepts.

*   **Resource:**  LeetCode (Free Tier)
    *   **Provider:** LeetCode
    *   **Description:**  A platform for practicing coding interview questions.  Focus on the Easy and Medium level problems in Python. Excellent for practicing data structures and algorithms.
    *   **Estimated Time Commitment:** 1-2 hours per week.
    *   **Link:** [https://leetcode.com/](https://leetcode.com/)
    *   **Cost:** Free (has a paid tier for premium content, but the free tier is sufficient to start).
    *   **Why it fits:**  LeetCode is all about hands-on coding practice.

**3. Suggested Schedule (10 hours per week)**

This is a sample schedule. Adjust it to fit your personal preferences and energy levels.  Break down larger time blocks into smaller, focused chunks (e.g., 25-minute Pomodoro sessions with short breaks).

*   **Monday:**
    *   FreeCodeCamp - Scientific Computing with Python (1.5 hours)
    *   MIT OCW Calculus - Lecture Review (1 hour)

*   **Tuesday:**
    *   CS50 - Problem Set Work (2 hours)

*   **Wednesday:**
    *   Khan Academy - Calculus Practice (1.5 hours)

*   **Thursday:**
    *   FreeCodeCamp - Scientific Computing with Python (1.5 hours)

*   **Friday:**
    *   Brilliant.org - Discrete Mathematics Problems (1 hour)

*   **Saturday/Sunday:**  (Flexible - choose one day to spread this out, or split it between both)
    *   LeetCode - Python Algorithm Practice (1 hour)
    *   MIT OCW Calculus - Problem Set Work (1 hour)
    *   CS50 - Lecture Review (Optional - 30 minutes)

**4. Additional Tools and Communities:**

*   **Coding Editors/IDEs:** VS Code (free), PyCharm Community Edition (free for Python). Experiment and find what you like.
*   **Online Forums/Communities:**
    *   **Reddit:** Subreddits like r/learnprogramming, r/computerscience, r/math, r/calculus.  Ask questions, share your progress, and get help from others.
    *   **Discord Servers:** Many online courses and communities have Discord servers for real-time interaction and support.
    *   **Stack Overflow:** A Q&A website for programming problems. Learn how to ask good questions!
*   **Note-Taking Apps:**  Use a digital notebook (OneNote, Evernote, Google Docs) to organize your notes, code snippets, and problem solutions. Writing down what you learn reinforces it.
*   **Whiteboard (Physical or Digital):** Useful for brainstorming solutions, drawing diagrams, and visualizing mathematical concepts.

**Key Considerations for Kinesthetic Learners:**

*   **Active Recall:**  Don't just passively read or watch.  Actively try to recall information and explain it in your own words.  Use flashcards or the Feynman Technique.
*   **Hands-On Activities:**  Prioritize practice problems and coding exercises.
*   **Mind Mapping:**  Create visual mind maps to connect different concepts.
*   **Physical Demonstrations:**  For math, try to visualize concepts using physical objects or drawings.
*   **Coding Projects:** Build small projects to solidify your understanding of programming concepts. The FreeCodeCamp curriculum is excellent for this.
*   **Take Breaks:**  Get up and move around regularly.  Physical activity can help you stay focused.

This plan is a starting point. Experiment, adapt, and find what works best for you.  The key is to stay consistent and actively engage with the material. Good luck!
