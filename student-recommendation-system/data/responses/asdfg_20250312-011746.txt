Okay, here's a personalized learning plan based on your preferences, focusing on free resources for High School Mathematics and Computer Science, tailored for a visual learner at an intermediate level with 40 hours per week, and a desire to improve skills in both subjects.

**Learning Plan Overview**

This plan balances structured learning (courses) with flexible learning (videos, problem-solving) and community engagement.  It prioritizes understanding foundational concepts and then applying them to practical problems.

**I. Mathematics**

*   **Goal:** Strengthen foundational math skills and explore more advanced concepts relevant to Computer Science.

**A. Recommended Resources:**

*   **Discord Servers:** Many CS50x cohorts and other programming communities have Discord servers for discussion, help, and collaboration.  Search for them online.
*   **Stack Overflow:** A question-and-answer website for programmers. Use it to find solutions to your coding problems. ([https://stackoverflow.com/](https://stackoverflow.com/))
*   **GitHub:**  A platform for sharing and collaborating on code.  Learn to use Git for version control and contribute to open-source projects. ([https://github.com/](https://github.com/))
*   **Math Stack Exchange:** Question-and-answer website for math related questions. ([https://math.stackexchange.com/](https://math.stackexchange.com/))
*   **Reddit:** Subreddits like r/learnprogramming and r/math can provide support and resources.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Consistency is Key:**  Stick to your schedule as much as possible. Even short, regular study sessions are more effective than infrequent long ones.
*   **Active Learning:** Don't just passively watch videos or read textbooks.  Take notes, solve problems, and write code.
*   **Don't Be Afraid to Ask for Help:**  The online communities are there to support you.
*   **Take Breaks:**  Avoid burnout by taking regular breaks.  Get up and move around, or do something completely unrelated to learning.
*   **Project-Based Learning:**  Once you have a basic understanding of the concepts, start working on personal projects.  This is the best way to solidify your knowledge and build a portfolio. For example, try to build a calculator, a simple website, or a data analysis project.
*   **Adapt and Adjust:**  This plan is a starting point. If something isn't working for you, adjust it.  Experiment with different resources and techniques until you find what works best for your learning style and goals.
*   **Mindset:**  Embrace challenges and don't be afraid to make mistakes. Learning is a process, and everyone struggles at times. Maintain a growth mindset â€“ the belief that your abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work.

Good luck with your learning journey! Let me know if you have any other questions.
