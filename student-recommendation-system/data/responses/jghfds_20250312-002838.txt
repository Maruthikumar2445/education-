    *   **Why:** Essential for larger Java projects.  The Coursera course will likely cover these.
*   **Stack Overflow:** A Q&A site for programmers.  Excellent for finding solutions to specific coding problems.
    *   **Why:**  A valuable resource for debugging and understanding concepts.
*   **Reddit:** Subreddits like r/java or r/learnjava are good for discussion and asking questions.
    *   **Why:** Connect with other learners and experienced developers.
*   **Java User Groups (JUGs):**  Local or online groups of Java enthusiasts.
    *   **Why:** Networking, learning from experts, and staying up-to-date with the latest Java developments.
*   **Java Discord Servers:** A great way to connect with other Java developers and ask for help.
    *   **Why:** A great way to get immediate feedback and find online communities.

**Important Notes:**

*   **Assess your current knowledge:** Start with a self-assessment of your Java skills. This will help you determine if you need to spend more or less time on the foundational concepts.
*   **Adjust the plan:** This is a guideline, not a rigid schedule.  Feel free to adjust it based on your progress, interests, and the demands of your university coursework.
*   **Don't be afraid to experiment:** Try different resources and approaches to find what works best for you.
*   **Focus on understanding, not just memorization:**  Strive to truly understand the underlying concepts, rather than just memorizing syntax or code snippets.
*   **Practice consistently:**  Regular practice is key to developing your Java skills.

Good luck with your learning journey!  Let me know if you have any other questions.
