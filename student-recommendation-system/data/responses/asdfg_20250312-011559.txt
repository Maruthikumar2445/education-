**Learning Goals (Based on your request to Improve Skills):**

To make this plan even more effective, it's crucial to define *specific* learning goals. Here are some examples, which you should adapt to your own aspirations:

*   **Mathematics:**
    *   Goal 1: Master the fundamentals of Precalculus (functions, trigonometry, logarithms) to prepare for Calculus.
    *   Goal 2: Understand the concepts of limits, derivatives, and integrals in single-variable Calculus.
    *   Goal 3: Be able to apply Calculus to solve real-world problems (optimization, related rates, etc.).
*   **Computer Science:**
    *   Goal 1: Build a responsive and visually appealing personal website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
    *   Goal 2: Understand fundamental data structures (arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs) and algorithms (sorting, searching).
    *   Goal 3:  Be able to solve coding problems on platforms like LeetCode (easy/medium difficulty).

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Consistency is Key:** The most important factor in your learning journey is consistency.  Try to stick to your schedule as much as possible, even if you only have a short amount of time.
*   **Don't Be Afraid to Ask for Help:**  If you're struggling with a concept, don't be afraid to ask for help from online forums, communities, or your teachers.
*   **Celebrate Your Progress:**  Acknowledge and celebrate your accomplishments along the way. Learning is a marathon, not a sprint.

This plan provides a solid foundation for your learning journey. Remember to stay curious, be persistent, and enjoy the process!  Good luck!
