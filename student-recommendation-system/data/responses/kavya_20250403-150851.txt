*   **Desmos Graphing Calculator:** A free, online graphing calculator that's perfect for visualizing functions and exploring mathematical concepts.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Consistency is Key:**  Even dedicating a small amount of time each day/week is more effective than cramming.
*   **Don't Be Afraid to Ask for Help:**  Utilize online communities and forums to get help when you're stuck.
*   **Practice, Practice, Practice:**  The more you practice, the better you'll understand the concepts.
*   **Adjust as Needed:** This is just a starting point.  Adjust the schedule and resources based on your individual needs and progress. If you're finding something too easy, move on to more challenging material. If you're struggling, review the fundamentals.
