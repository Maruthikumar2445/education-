Okay, here is a personalized learning plan designed for an undergraduate student with an expert-level understanding, a kinesthetic learning style, 37 hours a week to dedicate, and a goal to improve their Machine Learning (ML) skills.  It prioritizes hands-on learning and practical application.  I'll focus on advanced topics within ML suitable for someone already at an expert level.

**Please note:** At an expert level, a lot of learning comes from contributing to projects, reading cutting-edge research, and implementing new ideas. This plan reflects that.
**Subjects of Interest:** Other, Engineering + ML
**Learning Style:** Kinesthetic
**Difficulty Level:** Expert
**Time Availability:** 37 hours/week
**Learning Goals:** Improve Machine Learning (ML) skills

**Key Considerations:**

*   **Expert Level:** This plan assumes you have a strong foundation in linear algebra, calculus, probability, statistics, and programming (Python is assumed). It focuses on advanced topics and implementation.
*   **Kinesthetic Focus:** Emphasizes hands-on projects, coding challenges, and active participation in research.
*   **Time Commitment:** 37 hours/week is substantial. The schedule below divides it into manageable chunks, but flexibility is key.
*   **Paid Resources:**  I've included options that are paid for specific cases but many are free and open.

**Structured Learning Plan:**
