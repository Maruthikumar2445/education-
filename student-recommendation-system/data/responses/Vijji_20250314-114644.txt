**Important Considerations for the Schedule:**

*   **Flexibility:**  This is just a suggestion. Adjust based on your energy levels and other commitments.  Some weeks you might focus more on math, others on coding.
*   **Breaks:** Take frequent breaks during study sessions. The Pomodoro Technique (25 minutes work, 5 minutes break) can be helpful.
*   **Practice:** Don't just watch videos and read materials.  Spend time actively coding, solving problems, and working on projects. This is crucial for learning.
*   **Review:** Regularly review previously learned material to reinforce your understanding.
*   **Weekend Option:**  If weekdays are too busy, shift some of the schedule to the weekend.

**Additional Tools and Communities:**

*   **Coding Editors/IDEs:** VS Code, PyCharm (Community Edition - free), Repl.it (online IDE)
*   **Math Software:**  GeoGebra (free for geometry, algebra, calculus), Desmos (online graphing calculator)
*   **Online Communities:**
    *   **Stack Overflow:**  A great resource for getting answers to specific programming questions.
    *   **Reddit:** Subreddits like r/learnprogramming, r/computerscience, r/math.
    *   **Discord Servers:** Many online courses have associated Discord servers where you can interact with other learners.
*   **Note-Taking:**  Use a tool like Notion, OneNote, or even a physical notebook to take notes and organize your learning. Mind maps can be particularly helpful for visual learners.
*   **GitHub:** Learn to use GitHub for version control and to share your projects.

**Key Strategies for Visual Learners:**

*   **Diagrams and Charts:** Draw diagrams, flowcharts, and mind maps to visualize concepts.
*   **Color-Coding:** Use color-coding in your notes and code to highlight important information.
*   **Animations:** Look for resources that use animations and interactive simulations to explain concepts.
*   **Whiteboarding:** Use a whiteboard or virtual whiteboard to work through problems and brainstorm ideas.
*   **Code Visualization Tools:** Explore tools that visualize code execution or data structures.

**Important Tips:**

*   **Start Slow:** Don't try to do too much at once. Begin with the basics and gradually increase the difficulty.
*   **Be Patient:** Learning takes time and effort. Don't get discouraged if you don't understand something right away.
*   **Ask Questions:** Don't be afraid to ask questions in online forums or communities.
*   **Celebrate Successes:** Acknowledge and celebrate your progress, no matter how small.
*   **Stay Consistent:** Consistency is key to achieving your learning goals. Stick to your schedule as much as possible, even when you don't feel like it.

This plan is a starting point.  Be prepared to adjust it as you learn more about your own learning style and preferences. Good luck!
