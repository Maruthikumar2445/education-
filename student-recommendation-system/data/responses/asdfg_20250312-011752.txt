**Important Reminders:**

*   **Consistency is key:** Try to stick to your schedule as much as possible. Even short, regular study sessions are more effective than long, infrequent ones.
*   **Practice regularly:** The more you practice, the better you'll become.  Don't just passively watch videos; actively work through problems.
*   **Don't be afraid to ask for help:** If you're stuck, don't hesitate to ask for help from teachers, mentors, or online communities.
*   **Celebrate your progress:** Acknowledge your achievements along the way to stay motivated.

Good luck with your learning journey! Remember that this is a starting point. Experiment, adjust, and discover what works best for you.  Have fun!
