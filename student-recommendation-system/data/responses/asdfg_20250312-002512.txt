While not explicitly video-based, they often use diagrams, code snippets with highlighted explanations, and visual aids to clarify concepts. While some content is behind a paywall, there's a huge amount of free content.
    *   **Estimated Time Commitment:** 0-1 hours per week, based on need
    *   **Link:** [https://realpython.com/](https://realpython.com/)
    *   **Cost:** Free (with some paid content)
    *   **Why it matches:**  The clear writing style, use of examples, and strategic use of visual aids make even complex topics easier to understand.

**2.  Why These Resources Match Your Preferences:**

*   **Visual Learning:** The Python Visualizer is *directly* aimed at visual learners. CS50 uses engaging visuals in lectures. freeCodeCamp uses project based learning which enables visual understanding of code's impact. YouTube and Real Python offer video and diagram based content.
*   **Beginner Level:** All resources are geared towards beginners. They start with the basics and gradually introduce more advanced topics.
*   **Python Focus:** All resources are specifically focused on Python.
*   **Free Resources:** All the main resources are free to access (though some may offer paid upgrades for certifications or additional content).
*   **Online Courses & Videos:** The recommendations include both online courses and video tutorials.

**3. Suggested Schedule (10 Hours/Week):**

*   **Monday (2 hours):**
    *   CS50 Python: 1 hour Lecture.
    *   Python Visualizer: Experiment with code examples from the lecture. (1 hour)
*   **Tuesday (1 hour):**
    *   freeCodeCamp Python: Work on a project from the Scientific Computing with Python Certification (1 hour)
*   **Wednesday (2 hours):**
    *   CS50 Python: Work on the problem set (2 hours). Refer to Python Visualizer as needed.
*   **Thursday (1 hour):**
    *   freeCodeCamp Python: Work on a project from the Scientific Computing with Python Certification (1 hour)
*   **Friday (2 hours):**
    *   CS50 Python: Review any concepts you struggled with (1 hour).
    *   Sentdex YouTube Channel: Watch a Python tutorial relevant to a topic you are learning (1 hour).
*   **Saturday/Sunday (2 hours):**
    *   Flexibility!  Catch up on missed work, explore a new Python topic using Real Python, or continue working on your freeCodeCamp projects.  Use the time to consolidate your understanding.

**Important Considerations for the Schedule:**

*   **Consistency is Key:** Try to stick to the schedule as much as possible. Even small amounts of consistent practice are better than sporadic bursts.
*   **Don't be Afraid to Adjust:** If you find one course isn't working for you, switch it out. If you're consistently under or over on time, adjust the schedule accordingly.
*   **Breaks are Important:** Don't try to cram. Short, frequent breaks are more effective than long, infrequent ones.

**4. Additional Tools & Communities:**

*   **Integrated Development Environment (IDE):**  While you can use a text editor, an IDE provides helpful features like code completion, debugging, and syntax highlighting.  Consider Visual Studio Code (VS Code) or Thonny (very beginner-friendly). Both are free.
    *   **VS Code:** [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
    *   **Thonny:** [https://thonny.org/](https://thonny.org/)
*   **Online Communities:**
    *   **Stack Overflow:** For getting answers to specific coding questions.
    *   **Reddit (r/learnpython, r/python):**  For discussions, advice, and finding resources.
    *   **Discord Servers:** Many Python-related Discord servers exist, providing real-time chat and help.  Search for "Python Discord server" to find one that fits your interests.
*   **Version Control (Git and GitHub):**  While not strictly necessary at the beginning, learning Git and using GitHub for version control will be extremely valuable as you progress.  freeCodeCamp has free courses on Git.

**Tips for Success:**

*   **Practice Regularly:** Coding is a skill that requires practice. Write code every day, even if it's just for a few minutes.
*   **Don't Be Afraid to Experiment:** Try different things. Break things. See what happens. Experimentation is a great way to learn.
*   **Ask Questions:** If you're stuck, don't be afraid to ask for help on Stack Overflow, Reddit, or a Discord server.
*   **Set Realistic Goals:** Don't try to learn everything at once. Focus on one topic at a time and build your knowledge gradually.
*   **Celebrate Your Successes:** Acknowledge and celebrate your accomplishments, no matter how small. This will help you stay motivated and focused on your goals.
*   **Take advantage of ChatGPT or similar tools:** These can be a great resource for asking questions. Just be sure to verify the accuracy of the answers. They are not always correct.

This structured plan should provide a solid foundation for learning Python, taking advantage of your learning style and available time. Good luck!
