**Important Considerations:**

*   **Consistency:**  The most important thing is to be consistent. Even if you only spend a short amount of time each day, regular study will yield better results than sporadic cramming.
*   **Active Learning:**  Don't just passively watch videos. Take notes, pause to try coding examples, and actively engage with the material.
*   **Problem-Solving:**  Spend time working through problems.  This is crucial for solidifying your understanding.
*   **Don't be Afraid to Ask for Help:** If you get stuck, don't hesitate to ask for help on Stack Overflow, Reddit, or Discord.
*   **Adjust as Needed:**  This is just a starting point. Adjust the schedule, resources, and time commitments based on your individual needs and progress.  If a resource isn't working for you, don't be afraid to try something different.
*   **Focus on Understanding:** Focus on truly understanding the concepts, not just memorizing them. This will help you apply your knowledge to new situations.

Good luck with your learning journey! Remember to celebrate your progress and enjoy the process.
